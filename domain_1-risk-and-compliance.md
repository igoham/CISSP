# Security Frameworks

- NIST SP 800-53 - Provides a list of privacy and security controls
    - for us federal agencies and organizations
    - Provides 3 impact levels
        - Low
        - Medium
        - High
    - You must identify which impact level the system is identifed as. This is done in step one of NIST SP 800-37

- COSO - Mainly conferned with preventing internal financial fraud but does contain guidance on security
- HIPPA - 
- SOX - Requires top management to individually certify the accuracy of each finacial report and if the reports and found
to be flase the exec can be held personally liable 


## Privacy,

## Security and Risk Frameworks
### NIST SP 800-37 - Risk Management Framework

The RMF has six steps

- Categorize Information Systems
    - Determine the classification of the systems
    - Categorzation is applied based off FIPS 199
- Selection of security controls 
    - Fully based off the impact level of the determined in previous step
    - Controls can be found in NIST SP 800-53
- Implement the security controls
    - Take a long time as requires all of the work to be done
    - Requires SMEs, for example databases require a DBA to preform special configurations 
- Assessment
    - Assess the level of implementation per control
    - Looks at the evidence put in place, documentation with accrediation 
    - Ensure in a secure phyiscal location
    - Ensure technical controls are in place
- Authorize the system
    - An Authorizaing offical must accept the risk that is not mitigated by the controls
- Continuous monitoring
    - One the system is approved we contineously monitor the controlls to ensure they are effective
    - Ensures the system always maintains the same level of risk as it was initially accepted with
### Fips-199

Used to determine classification levels of systems in NIST SP 800-37

## COSO

-  identifies 17
internal control principles that are grouped into five internal control components as
listed here.
### Control Environment:
1. Demonstrates commitment to integrity and ethical values
2. Exercises oversight responsibilities
3. Establishes structure, authority, and responsibility
4. Demonstrates commitment to competence
5. Enforces accountability
### Risk Assessment:
6. Specifies suitable objectives
7. Identifies and analyzes risk
8. Assesses fraud risk
9. Identifies and analyzes significant change
### Control Activities:
10. Selects and develops control activities
11. Selects and develops general controls over technology
12. Deploys through policies and procedures
### Information and Communication:
13. Uses relevant, quality information
14. Communicates internally
15. Communicates externally
84
### Monitoring Activities:
16. Conducts ongoing and/or separate evaluations
17. Evaluates and communicates deficiencies

**Define the following terms**
- Trademark
- Copyright
- IP
    - Intellectual property is any data, software, algorithm or knowledge created within a company or by an individual
- Trade Secret 
    - Any information that would give a company an operational edge
- Patent
    - A patent is the strong form of IP protection
    - Must be novel, useful and not obvious
    
**Software Piracy**
This is a huge issue!
