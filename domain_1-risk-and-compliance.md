## Security and Risk Frameworks

- NIST SP 800-53 - Provides a list of privacy and security controls
    - for us federal agencies and organizations
    - Provides 3 impact levels
        - Low
        - Medium
        - High
    - You must identify which impact level the system is identifed as. This is done in step one of NIST SP 800-37

- HIPPA - 
- SOX - Requires top management to individually certify the accuracy of each finacial report and if the reports and found
to be flase the exec can be held personally liable 




### NIST SP 800-37 - Risk Management Framework

The RMF has six steps

- Categorize Information Systems
    - Determine the classification of the systems
    - Categorzation is applied based off FIPS 199
- Selection of security controls 
    - Fully based off the impact level of the determined in previous step
    - Controls can be found in NIST SP 800-53
- Implement the security controls
    - Take a long time as requires all of the work to be done
    - Requires SMEs, for example databases require a DBA to preform special configurations 
- Assessment
    - Assess the level of implementation per control
    - Looks at the evidence put in place, documentation with accrediation 
    - Ensure in a secure phyiscal location
    - Ensure technical controls are in place
- Authorize the system
    - An Authorizaing offical must accept the risk that is not mitigated by the controls
- Continuous monitoring
    - One the system is approved we contineously monitor the controlls to ensure they are effective
    - Ensures the system always maintains the same level of risk as it was initially accepted with
### Fips-199

Used to determine classification levels of systems in NIST SP 800-37

## COSO

-  identifies 17
internal control principles that are grouped into five internal control components as
listed here.
- Mainly conferned with preventing internal financial fraud but does contain guidance on security
### Control Environment:
1. Demonstrates commitment to integrity and ethical values
2. Exercises oversight responsibilities
3. Establishes structure, authority, and responsibility
4. Demonstrates commitment to competence
5. Enforces accountability
### Risk Assessment:
6. Specifies suitable objectives
7. Identifies and analyzes risk
8. Assesses fraud risk
9. Identifies and analyzes significant change
### Control Activities:
10. Selects and develops control activities
11. Selects and develops general controls over technology
12. Deploys through policies and procedures
### Information and Communication:
13. Uses relevant, quality information
14. Communicates internally
15. Communicates externally
84
### Monitoring Activities:
16. Conducts ongoing and/or separate evaluations
17. Evaluates and communicates deficiencies

# Privacy
## EU-US Privacy shield

https://www.privacyshield.gov/

The Privacy sheild has the following principles

1. Notice
    - Must provide notice for a long list of items - https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=1-NOTICE
2. Choice
    - Individuals should have the opportunity to opt out
    - (i) to be disclosed to a third party or 
    - (ii) to be used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individuals
3. Accountability for Onward Transfer
    - 3p must also use for the agreed upon purpose
    - Must adbive by above rules
    - ascertain that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles; 
    - (iii) take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the personal information transferred in a manner consistent with the organization’s obligations under the Principles;
4. Security
5. Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation
6. Access
    - ndividuals must have access to personal information about them that an organization holds and be able to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the Principles, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
7. Recourse, Enforcement and Liability

## 8 principles of GDPR**

1. The right to be informed

    - Both data processors and controllers are now obliged to provide information to data subjects about the personal data being collected, how it is going to be used, who it will be shared with, for how long it will be kept and the purpose of its processing.

1. The right of access

    - With request, individual data subjects are entitled to confirmation that their data is being processed, access to that data as well as further information regarding any automated decision making, or the envisioned period of retention.

1. The right to rectification

    - With its corresponding principle in ‘accuracy’, data subjects hold the right to have personal data rectified should it be either inaccurate or incomplete.

1. The right to erasure

    - Also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’, this right allows data subjects to request the removal or deletion of data in the eventuality there is no compelling reason for its continued processing or availability. This right may in some circumstances also obligate, for instance, a search engine company to remove certain results, or limit their discoverability.

1. The right to restrict processing

    - Processing is any operation performed on personal data. This includes using, viewing, altering or deleting the data. Individuals may block or suppress processing of personal data for the following reasons: Inaccurate data, the unlawful processing of that data or a pending objection to processing the data by the data subject

1. The right to data portability

    - Allowing individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data across different services, this right means an individual’s data should be available in a commonly used machine-readable format, in a way which allows data not to be constantly resubmitted.

1. The right to object

    - Allowing individual to object (for certain reasons) to the processing of their personal data, as well as obliging organisations to inform individuals of this right at the time of first communication.

1. Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.

    - One of the more detailed and technical rights afforded under the GDPR, among other things, entitles individuals either opt out of automated decision-making processes, challenge decisions, and/or have automated decisions reviewed by a human. More about this right can be found here.




**Define the following terms**
- Trademark
- Copyright
- IP
    - Intellectual property is any data, software, algorithm or knowledge created within a company or by an individual
- Trade Secret 
    - Any information that would give a company an operational edge
- Patent
    - A patent is the strong form of IP protection
    - Must be novel, useful and not obvious
    
**Software Piracy**

This is a huge issue!
