# Security Frameworks

- NIST SP 800-53 - Provides a set of privacy and security controls
    - for us federal agencies and organizations
    - Provides 3 impact levels
        - Low
        - Medium
        - High
    - You must identify which      

- COSO - Mainly conferned with preventing internal financial fraud but does contain guidance on security
- HIPPA - 
- SOX - Requires top management to individually certify the accuracy of each finacial report and if the reports and found
to be flase the exec can be held personally liable 


## Privacy,

## Risk
### NIST SP 800-37 - Risk Management Framework

The RMF has six steps

- Categorize Information Systems
    - Determine the classification of the systems
    - Categorzation is applied based off FIPS 199
- Selection of security controls 
    - Fully based off the impact level of the determined in previous step
    - Controls can be found in NIST SP 800-53
- Implement the security controls
    - Take a long time as requires all of the work to be done
    - Requires SMEs, for example databases require a DBA to preform special configurations 
- Assessment
    - Assess the level of implementation per control
    - Looks at the evidence put in place, documentation with accrediation 
    - Ensure in a secure phyiscal location
    - Ensure technical controls are in place
- Authorize the system
    - An Authorizaing offical must accept the risk that is not mitigated by the controls
- Continuous monitoring
    - One the system is approved we contineously monitor the controlls to ensure they are effective
    - Ensures the system always maintains the same level of risk as it was initially accepted with
### Fips-199

Used to determine classification levels of systems in NIST SP 800-37

- Copyright
- IP
    - Intellectual property is any data, software, algorithm or knowledge created within a company or by an individual
- Trade Secret 
    - Any information that would give a company an operational edge

This is a huge issue!
