## Fire Suppression

The American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM) is the organization that creates the standards that dictate how these
tests should be performed and how to properly interpret the test results

. Fire resistance represents the ability of a laboratory-constructed assembly
to contain a fire for a specific period. For example, a 5/8-inch-thick drywall sheet
installed on each side of a wood stud provides a one-hour rating. If the thickness of this
drywall is doubled, then this would be given a two-hour rating

Most computer circuits use only 2 to 5 volts of direct
current, which usually cannot start a fire.
