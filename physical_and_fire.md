## Fire Suppression

The American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM) is the organization that creates the standards that dictate how these
tests should be performed and how to properly interpret the test results

. Fire resistance represents the ability of a laboratory-constructed assembly
to contain a fire for a specific period. For example, a 5/8-inch-thick drywall sheet
installed on each side of a wood stud provides a one-hour rating. If the thickness of this
drywall is doubled, then this would be given a two-hour rating

A fire needs fuel, oxygen, and high temperatures. Table 3-6 shows how different
suppression substances interfere with these elements of fire.

**NOTE** Halon has not been manufactured since January 1, 1992, by international
agreement. The Montreal Protocol banned halon in 1987, and countries were given
until 1992 to comply with these directives. The most effective replacement for halon is
FM-200, which is similar to halon but does not damage the ozone.


#### Water Sprinklers

Water sprinklers typically are simpler and less expensive than FM-200 system, but can
cause water damage. In an electrical fire, the water can increase the intensity of the fire
because it can work as a conductor for electricity—only making the situation worse. If
water is going to be used in any type of environment with electrical equipment, the
electricity must be turned off before the water is released. Sensors should be used to shut

down the electric power before water sprinklers activate. Each sprinkler head should
activate individually to avoid wide-area damage, and there should be shutoff valves so the
water supply can be stopped if necessary.
A company should take great care in deciding which suppression agent and system is
best for it. Four main types of water sprinkler systems are available:


- Wet pipe Wet pipe systems always contain water in the pipes and are usually
discharged by temperature control–level sensors. One disadvantage of wet pipe
systems is that the water in the pipes may freeze in colder climates. Also, if there is a
nozzle or pipe break, it can cause extensive water damage. These types of systems are
also called closed-head systems.

- Dry pipe In dry pipe systems, the water is not actually held in the pipes. The water is
contained in a “holding tank” until it is released. The pipes hold pressurized air,
which is reduced when a fire or smoke alarm is activated, allowing the water valve to
be opened by the water pressure. Water is not allowed into the pipes that feed the
sprinklers until an actual fire is detected. First, a heat or smoke sensor is activated;
then, the water fills the pipes leading to the sprinkler heads, the fire alarm sounds, the
electric power supply is disconnected, and finally water is allowed to flow from the
sprinklers. These pipes are best used in colder climates because the pipes will not
freeze. Figure 3-62 depicts a dry pipe system.

- Preaction Preaction systems are similar to dry pipe systems in that the water is not
held in the pipes, but is released when the pressurized air within the pipes is reduced.
Once this happens, the pipes are filled with water, but it is not released right away. A
thermal-fusible link on the sprinkler head has to melt before the water is released. The
purpose of combining these two techniques is to give people more time to respond to
false alarms or to small fires that can be handled by other means. Putting out a small
fire with a handheld extinguisher is better than losing a lot of electrical equipment to
water damage. These systems are usually used only in data processing environments
rather than the whole building because of the higher cost of these types of systems.

- Deluge A deluge system has its sprinkler heads wide open to allow a larger volume of
water to be released in a shorter period. Because the water being released is in such
large volumes, these systems are usually not used in data processing environments.

## Types of fire extinguishers
	 Wet Pipes - caries water the entire time until the water is relased
	 Dry Pipes - pipes are empty and filled with presurized air until the pipes require water
	 Preaction systems - Filled with air until the presure changes, it then fills with water. Once the head melts it releases the water. Used in computing envrioments to allow more time to put out small fires and save electrical equpitment
	 Deluge - large basin of water that is dumped on the source of the fire to attempt to cool it down
     Misting - can be used while devices are still one


## Computer Related Power topics

Most computer circuits use only 2 to 5 volts of direct
current, which usually cannot start a fire.

**Evacuation proceedures?**
Evacuation Routes

All personnel should be advised of the quickest evacuation routes from their area including guest. All sites should use a meeting point in the event of an emergency, so that people don’t mistakenly reenter the site searching for people.
Evacuation Roles and Procedures

- Safety Warden – Ensures all personnel safely evacuate the building in the event of an emergency or drill
- Meeting point leader – Assures all personel are accounted for a the emergency meeting point

All personnel should follow evacuation procedures and posted route. All sites should have mitigating controls lot allow safe egress of all personnel.


#### Heat Detectors
Alerts when temperature exceeds a certain baseline.

#### Smoke Detectors
Can be ionization based or photoelectric based. Both types of alarm Alavert when smoke interrupts radioactivity or light, lowering or blocking the electric charge. Dust can sometimes lead to false alarms.

#### Flame Detectors
Detect infrared or ultraviolet light emitted in fire. The drawback is it requires line of sight from the flame where as smoke detectors don’t.


#### Positive Pressure and Drains

Air and water should be expelled from the building. Untreated air should be never be inhaled into the building, and water should drain away from the building. A common HVAC malfunction is condensation of water pooling into the building, often going under raised floors where it may not be detected. Positive drains are designed to avoid this problem. Location of all gas and waterlines , as well as all drains should be formally documented.
#### Heat and Humidity

Datacenters should operate within humidity levels of 40-55% and temperature range of 68-77F (20-25C).
#### Static and Corrosion

Low humidity can cause static buildup damaging equipment. Maintaining proper humidity and grounding, using antistatic sprays, wrist wraps and work surfaces helps mitigate this risk. High humidity level can allow water in the air to condense onto equipment leading to corrosion.
#### Airborne Contaminants

Dust can cause overheating and static building, and clog CPU fans causing component failures. HVAC should operating in closed loops require HEPA filters to filter contaminants
