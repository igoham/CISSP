# Chapter One - Risk

The objectives of security are to provide availability, integrity, and confidentiality
protection to data and resources.
237
- A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that allows a threat source to compromise its
security.
- A threat is the possibility that someone or something would exploit a vulnerability,
either intentionally or accidentally, and cause harm to an asset.
- A risk is the probability of a threat agent exploiting a vulnerability and the loss
potential from that action.
- A countermeasure, also called a safeguard or control, mitigates the risk.
- A control can be administrative, technical, or physical and can provide deterrent,
preventive, detective, corrective, or recovery protection.
- A compensating control is an alternative control that is put into place because of
financial or business functionality reasons.
- COBIT is a framework of control objectives and allows for IT governance.
- ISO/IEC 27001 is the standard for the establishment, implementation, control, and
improvement of the information security management system.
- The ISO/IEC 27000 series were derived from BS 7799 and are international best
practices on how to develop and maintain a security program.
- Enterprise architecture frameworks are used to develop architectures for specific
stakeholders and present information in views.
- An information security management system (ISMS) is a coherent set of policies,
processes, and systems to manage risks to information assets as outlined in ISO\IEC
27001.
- Enterprise security architecture is a subset of business architecture and a way to
describe current and future security processes, systems, and subunits to ensure
strategic alignment.
- Blueprints are functional definitions for the integration of technology into business
processes.
- Enterprise architecture frameworks are used to build individual architectures that best
map to individual organizational needs and business drivers.
- Zachman Framework is an enterprise architecture framework, and SABSA is a
security enterprise architecture framework.
- COSO Internal Control—Integrated Framework is a governance model used to help
prevent fraud within a corporate environment.
- ITIL is a set of best practices for IT service management.
- Six Sigma is used to identify defects in processes so that the processes can be
improved upon.
- CMMI is a maturity model that allows for processes to improve in an incremented
and standard approach.
- Security enterprise architecture should tie in strategic alignment, business
enablement, process enhancement, and security effectiveness.
- NIST SP 800-53 uses the following control categories: technical, management, and
238
operational.
- Civil law system
- Uses prewritten rules and is not based on precedent.
- Is different from civil (tort) laws, which work under a common law system.
- Common law system
- Made up of criminal, civil, and administrative laws.
- Customary law system
- Addresses mainly personal conduct and uses regional traditions and customs as the
foundations of the laws.
- Is usually mixed with another type of listed legal system rather than being the sole
legal system used in a region.
- Religious law system
- Laws are derived from religious beliefs and address an individual’s religious
responsibilities; commonly used in Muslim countries or regions.
- Mixed law system
- Uses two or more legal systems.
- Criminal law deals with an individual’s conduct that violates government laws
developed to protect the public.
- Civil law deals with wrongs committed against individuals or companies that result in
injury or damages. Civil law does not use prison time as a punishment, but usually
requires financial restitution.
- Administrative, or regulatory, law covers standards of performance or conduct
expected by government agencies from companies, industries, and certain officials.
- A patent grants ownership and enables that owner to legally enforce his rights to
exclude others from using the invention covered by the patent.
- Copyright protects the expression of ideas rather than the ideas themselves.
- Trademarks protect words, names, product shapes, symbols, colors, or a combination
of these used to identify products or a company. These items are used to distinguish
products from the competitors’ products.
- Trade secrets are deemed proprietary to a company and often include information
that provides a competitive edge. The information is protected as long as the owner
takes the necessary protective actions.
- Crime over the Internet has brought about jurisdiction problems for law enforcement
and the courts.
- Privacy laws dictate that data collected by government agencies must be collected
fairly and lawfully, must be used only for the purpose for which it was collected, must
only be held for a reasonable amount of time, and must be accurate and timely.
- When choosing the right safeguard to reduce a specific risk, the cost, functionality,
and effectiveness must be evaluated and a cost/benefit analysis performed.
239
- A security policy is a statement by management dictating the role security plays in the
organization.
- Procedures are detailed step-by-step actions that should be followed to achieve a
certain task.
- Standards are documents that outline rules that are compulsory in nature and support
the organization’s security policies.
- A baseline is a minimum level of security.
- Guidelines are recommendations and general approaches that provide advice and
flexibility.
- OCTAVE is a team-oriented risk management methodology that employs workshops
and is commonly used in the commercial sector.
- Security management should work from the top down (from senior management
down to the staff).
- Risk can be transferred, avoided, reduced, or accepted.
- Threats × vulnerability × asset value = total risk
- (Threats × vulnerability × asset value) × controls gap = residual risk
- The main goals of risk analysis are the following: identify assets and assign values to
them, identify vulnerabilities and threats, quantify the impact of potential threats, and
provide an economic balance between the impact of the risk and the cost of the
safeguards.
- Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is a method for determining functions,
identifying functional failures, and assessing the causes of failure and their failure
effects through a structured process.
- A fault tree analysis is a useful approach to detect failures that can take place within
complex environments and systems.
- A quantitative risk analysis attempts to assign monetary values to components within
the analysis.
- A purely quantitative risk analysis is not possible because qualitative items cannot be
quantified with precision.
- Capturing the degree of uncertainty when carrying out a risk analysis is important,
because it indicates the level of confidence the team and management should have in
the resulting figures.
- Automated risk analysis tools reduce the amount of manual work involved in the
analysis. They can be used to estimate future expected losses and calculate the benefits
of different security measures.
- Single loss expectancy × frequency per year = annualized loss expectancy (SLE × ARO
= ALE)
- Qualitative risk analysis uses judgment and intuition instead of numbers.
- Qualitative risk analysis involves people with the requisite experience and education
evaluating threat scenarios and rating the probability, potential loss, and severity of
240
each threat based on their personal experience.
- The Delphi technique is a group decision method where each group member can
communicate anonymously.
- Job rotation is a detective administrative control to detect fraud.
- Mandatory vacations are a detective administrative control type that can help detect
fraudulent activities.
- Separation of duties ensures no single person has total control over a critical activity
or task. It is a preventive administrative control.
- Split knowledge and dual control are two aspects of separation of duties.
- Management must define the scope and purpose of security management, provide
support, appoint a security team, delegate responsibility, and review the team’s
findings.
- The risk management team should include individuals from different departments
within the organization, not just technical personnel.
- Social engineering is a nontechnical attack carried out to manipulate a person into
providing sensitive data to an unauthorized individual.
- Personally identifiable information (PII) is a collection of identity-based data that can
be used in identity theft and financial fraud, and thus must be highly protected.
- A supply chain is a sequence of suppliers involved in delivering some product.
- A service level agreement (SLA) is a contractual agreement that states that a service
provider guarantees a certain level of service.
- Security governance is a framework that provides oversight, accountability, and
compliance.
- ISO/IEC 27004:2016 is an international standard for information security
measurement management.
- NIST SP 800-55 is a standard for performance measurement for information
security.
- Business continuity management (BCM) is the overarching approach to managing all
aspects of BCP and DRP.
- A business continuity plan (BCP) contains strategy documents that provide detailed
procedures that ensure critical business functions are maintained and that help
minimize losses of life, operations, and systems.
- A BCP provides procedures for emergency responses, extended backup operations,
and post-disaster recovery.
- A BCP should have an enterprise-wide reach, with individual organizational units
each having its own detailed continuity and contingency plans.
- A BCP needs to prioritize critical applications and provide a sequence for efficient
recovery.
- A BCP requires senior executive management support for initiating the plan and final
approval.
241
- BCPs can quickly become outdated due to personnel turnover, reorganizations, and
undocumented changes.
- Executives may be held liable if proper BCPs are not developed and used.
- Threats can be natural, manmade, or technical.
- The steps of recovery planning include initiating the project; performing business
impact analyses; developing a recovery strategy; developing a recovery plan; and
implementing, testing, and maintaining the plan.
- The project initiation phase involves getting management support, developing the
scope of the plan, and securing funding and resources.
- The business impact analysis (BIA) is one of the most important first steps in the
planning development. Qualitative and quantitative data on the business impact of a
disaster need to be gathered, analyzed, interpreted, and presented to management.
- Executive commitment and support are the most critical elements in developing the
BCP.
- A business case must be presented to gain executive support. This is done by
explaining regulatory and legal requirements, exposing vulnerabilities, and providing
solutions.
- Plans should be prepared by the people who will actually carry them out.
- The planning group should comprise representatives from all departments or
organizational units.
- The BCP team should identify the individuals who will interact with external players,
such as the reporters, shareholders, customers, and civic officials. Response to the
disaster should be done quickly and honestly, and should be consistent with any other
organizational response.
- ISO/IEC 27031:2011 describes the concepts and principles of information and
communication technology (ICT) readiness for business continuity.
- ISO/IEC 22301 is the standard for business continuity management (BCM).


# Chapter Two - Asset Security


- Information goes through a life cycle that starts with its acquisition and ends with its
disposal.
- Each phase of the information life cycle requires different considerations when
assessing risks and selecting controls.
- New information is prepared for use by adding metadata, including classification
labels.
- Ensuring the consistency of data must be a deliberate process in organizations that
use data replication.
- Data aggregation may lead to an increase in classification levels.
- Cryptography can be an effective control at all phases of the information life cycle.
- The data retention policy drives the timeframe at which information transitions from
the archival phase to the disposal phase of its life cycle.
- Information classification corresponds to the information’s value to the organization.
- Each classification should have separate handling requirements and procedures
pertaining to how that data is accessed, used, and destroyed.
- Senior executives are ultimately responsible to the shareholders for the successes and
failures of their corporations, including security issues.
- The data owner is the manager in charge of a specific business unit and is ultimately
responsible for the protection and use of a specific subset of information.
- Data owners specify the classification of data, and data custodians implement and
maintain controls to enforce the set classification levels.
- The data retention policy must consider legal, regulatory, and operational
requirements.
- The data retention policy should address what data is to be retained, where, how, and
for how long.
- Electronic discovery (e-discovery) is the process of producing for a court or external
attorney all electronically stored information (ESI) pertinent to a legal proceeding.
- Normal deletion of a file does not permanently remove it from media.
- NIST SP 800-88, Revision 1, “Guidelines for Media Sanitization,” describes the best
practices for combating data remanence.
- Overwriting data entails replacing the 1’s and 0’s that represent it on storage media
with random or fixed patterns of 1’s and 0’s to render the original data unrecoverable.
- Degaussing is the process of removing or reducing the magnetic field patterns on
311
conventional disk drives or tapes.
- Privacy pertains to personal information, both from your employees and your
customers.
- Generally speaking, organizations should collect the least amount of private personal
data required for the performance of their business functions.
- Data at rest refers to data that resides in external or auxiliary storage devices, such as
hard drives or optical discs.
- Every major operating system supports whole-disk encryption, which is a good way to
protect data at rest.
- Data in motion is data that is moving between computing nodes over a data network
such as the Internet.
- TLS, IPSec, and VPNs are typical ways to use cryptography to protect data in
motion.
- Data in use is the term for data residing in primary storage devices, such as volatile
memory (e.g., RAM), memory caches, or CPU registers.
- Scoping is taking a broader standard and trimming out the irrelevant or otherwise
unwanted parts.
- Tailoring is when you make changes to specific provisions in a standard so they better
address your requirements.
- A data leak means that the confidentiality of the data has been compromised.
- Data leak prevention (DLP) comprises the actions that organizations take to prevent
unauthorized external parties from gaining access to sensitive data.
- Network DLP (NDLP) applies data protection policies to data in motion.
- Endpoint DLP (EDLP) applies data protection policies to data at rest and data in use.
- Mobile devices are easily lost or stolen and should proactively be configured to
mitigate the risks of data loss or leakage.
- Paper products oftentimes contain information that deserves controls commensurate
to the sensitivity and criticality of that information.



# Chapter Three - Security Engineering


- System architecture is a formal tool used to design computer systems in a manner
that ensures each of the stakeholders’ concerns is addressed.
- A system’s architecture is made up of different views, which are representations of
system components and their relationships. Each view addresses a different aspect of
the system (functionality, performance, interoperability, security).
- ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 is an international standard that outlines how system
architecture frameworks and their description languages are to be used.
- A CPU contains a control unit, which controls the timing of the execution of
instructions and data, and an ALU, which performs mathematical functions and
logical operations.
- Memory managers use various memory protection mechanisms, as in base
(beginning) and limit (ending) addressing, address space layout randomization, and
data execution prevention.
- Operating systems use absolute (hardware addresses), logical (indexed addresses), and
relative address (indexed addresses, including offsets) memory schemes.
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities are best addressed by implementing bounds checking.
- A garbage collector is a software tool that releases unused memory segments to help
prevent “memory starvation.”
- Different processor families work within different microarchitectures to execute
specific instruction sets.
- Early operating systems were considered “monolithic” because all of the code worked
within one layer and ran in kernel mode, and components communicated in an ad
hoc manner.
- Operating systems can work within the following architectures: monolithic kernel,
layered, microkernel, or hybrid kernel.
- Mode transition is when a CPU has to switch from executing one process’s
instructions running in user mode to another process’s instructions running in kernel
mode.
- CPUs provide a ringed architecture, which operating systems run within. The more
565
trusted processes run in the lower-numbered rings and have access to all or most of
the system resources. Nontrusted processes run in higher-numbered rings and have
access to a smaller amount of resources.
- Operating system processes are executed in privileged mode (also called kernel or
supervisor mode), and applications are executed in user mode, also known as
“problem state.”
- Virtual memory combines RAM and secondary storage so the system seems to have a
larger bank of memory.
- The more complex a security mechanism is, the less amount of assurance it can
usually provide.
- The trusted computing base (TCB) is a collection of system components that
enforces the security policy directly and protects the system. These components are
within the security perimeter.
- Components that make up the TCB are hardware, software, and firmware that
provide some type of security protection.
- A security perimeter is an imaginary boundary that has trusted components within it
(those that make up the TCB) and untrusted components outside it.
- The reference monitor concept is an abstract machine that ensures all subjects have
the necessary access rights before accessing objects. Therefore, it mediates all access to
objects by subjects.
- The security kernel is the mechanism that actually enforces the rules of the reference
monitor concept.
- The security kernel must isolate processes carrying out the reference monitor concept,
must be tamperproof, must be invoked for each access attempt, and must be small
enough to be properly tested.
- Processes need to be isolated, which can be done through segmented memory
addressing, encapsulation of objects, time multiplexing of shared resources, naming
distinctions, and virtual mapping.
- The level of security a system provides depends upon how well it enforces its security
policy.
- A closed system is often proprietary to the manufacturer or vendor, whereas an open
system allows for more interoperability.
- The Common Criteria was developed to provide globally recognized evaluation
criteria.
- The Common Criteria uses protection profiles, security targets, and ratings (EAL1 to
EAL7) to provide assurance ratings for targets of evaluation (TOEs).
- Certification is the technical evaluation of a system or product and its security
components. Accreditation is management’s formal approval and acceptance of the
security provided by a system.
- ISO/IEC 15408 is the international standard that is used as the basis for the
evaluation of security properties of products under the CC framework.
566
- Process isolation ensures that multiple processes can run concurrently and the
processes will not interfere with each other or affect each other’s memory segments.
- TOC/TOU stands for time-of-check/time-of-use. This is a class of asynchronous
attacks.
- A distributed system is a system in which multiple computing nodes, interconnected
by a network, exchange information for the accomplishment of collective tasks.
- Cloud computing is the use of shared, remote computing devices for the purpose of
providing improved efficiencies, performance, reliability, scalability, and security.
- Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides users access to
a specific application that executes on the service provider’s environment.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides users access to
a computing platform that is typically built on a server operating system, but not the
virtual machine on which it runs.
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides users
unfettered access to a cloud device, such as an instance of a server, which includes
both the operating system and the virtual machine on which it runs.
- Parallel computing is the simultaneous use of multiple computers to solve a specific
task by dividing it among the available computers.
- Any system in which computers and physical devices collaborate via the exchange of
inputs and outputs to accomplish a task or objective is a cyber-physical system.
- Cryptography is the science of protecting information by encoding it into an
unreadable format.
- The most famous rotor encryption machine is the Enigma used by the Germans in
World War II.
- A readable message is in a form called plaintext, and once it is encrypted, it is in a
form called ciphertext.
- Cryptographic algorithms are the mathematical rules that dictate the functions of
enciphering and deciphering.
- Cryptanalysis is the study of breaking cryptosystems.
- Nonrepudiation is a service that ensures the sender cannot later falsely deny sending a
message.
- Key clustering is an instance in which two different keys generate the same ciphertext
from the same plaintext.
- The range of possible keys is referred to as the keyspace. A larger keyspace and the full
use of the keyspace allow for more random keys to be created. This provides more
protection.
- The two basic types of encryption mechanisms used in symmetric ciphers are
substitution and transposition. Substitution ciphers change a character (or bit) out for
another, while transposition ciphers scramble the characters (or bits).
- A polyalphabetic cipher uses more than one alphabet to defeat frequency analysis.
567
- Steganography is a method of hiding data within another media type, such as a
graphic, WAV file, or document. This method is used to hide the existence of the
data.
- A key is a random string of bits inserted into an encryption algorithm. The result
determines what encryption functions will be carried out on a message and in what
order.
- In symmetric key algorithms, the sender and receiver use the same key for encryption
and decryption purposes.
- In asymmetric key algorithms, the sender and receiver use different keys for
encryption and decryption purposes.
- Symmetric key processes provide barriers of secure key distribution and scalability.
However, symmetric key algorithms perform much faster than asymmetric key
algorithms.
- Symmetric key algorithms can provide confidentiality, but not authentication or
nonrepudiation.
- Examples of symmetric key algorithms include DES, 3DES, Blowfish, IDEA, RC4,
RC5, RC6, and AES.
- Asymmetric algorithms are used to encrypt keys, and symmetric algorithms are used
to encrypt bulk data.
- Asymmetric key algorithms are much slower than symmetric key algorithms, but can
provide authentication and nonrepudiation services.
- Examples of asymmetric key algorithms include RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman, El
Gamal, knapsack, and DSA.
- Two main types of symmetric algorithms are stream ciphers and block ciphers.
Stream ciphers use a keystream generator and encrypt a message one bit at a time. A
block cipher divides the message into groups of bits and encrypts them.
- Many algorithms are publicly known, so the secret part of the process is the key. The
key provides the necessary randomization to encryption.
- Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a block cipher that divides a message into 64-bit
blocks and employs S-box-type functions on them.
- Because technology has allowed the DES keyspace to be successfully broken, TripleDES (3DES) was developed to be used instead. 3DES uses 48 rounds of computation
and up to three different keys.
- International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) is a symmetric block cipher with a
key of 128 bits.
- RSA is an asymmetric algorithm developed by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman and is
the de facto standard for digital signatures.
- Elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECCs) are used as asymmetric algorithms and can
provide digital signature, secure key distribution, and encryption functionality. They
use fewer resources, which makes them better for wireless device and cell phone
encryption use.
568
- When symmetric and asymmetric key algorithms are used together, this is called a
hybrid system. The asymmetric algorithm encrypts the symmetric key, and the
symmetric key encrypts the data.
- A session key is a symmetric key used by the sender and receiver of messages for
encryption and decryption purposes. The session key is only good while that
communication session is active and then it is destroyed.
- A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a framework of programs, procedures,
communication protocols, and public key cryptography that enables a diverse group
of individuals to communicate securely.
- A certificate authority (CA) is a trusted third party that generates and maintains user
certificates, which hold their public keys.
- The CA uses a certification revocation list (CRL) to keep track of revoked certificates.
- A certificate is the mechanism the CA uses to associate a public key to a person’s
identity.
- A registration authority (RA) validates the user’s identity and then sends the request
for a certificate to the CA. The RA cannot generate certificates.
- A one-way function is a mathematical function that is easier to compute in one
direction than in the opposite direction.
- RSA is based on a one-way function that factors large numbers into prime numbers.
Only the private key knows how to use the trapdoor and how to decrypt messages
that were encrypted with the corresponding public key.
- Hashing algorithms provide data integrity only.
- When a hash algorithm is applied to a message, it produces a message digest, and this
value is signed with a private key to produce a digital signature.
- Some examples of hashing algorithms include SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, MD4, and
MD5.
- SHA produces a 160-bit hash value and is used in DSS.
- A birthday attack is an attack on hashing functions through brute force. The attacker
tries to create two messages with the same hashing value.
- A one-time pad uses a pad with random values that are XORed against the message to
produce ciphertext. The pad is at least as long as the message itself and is used once
and then discarded.
- A digital signature is the result of a user signing a hash value with a private key. It
provides authentication, data integrity, and nonrepudiation. The act of signing is the
actual encryption of the value with the private key.
- Examples of algorithms used for digital signatures include RSA, El Gamal, ECDSA,
and DSA.
- Key management is one of the most challenging pieces of cryptography. It pertains to
creating, maintaining, distributing, and destroying cryptographic keys.
- Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) combines the physical
569
environment and sociology issues that surround it to reduce crime rates and the fear
of crime.
- The value of property within the facility and the value of the facility itself need to be
ascertained to determine the proper budget for physical security so that security
controls are cost effective.
- Some physical security controls may conflict with the safety of people. These issues
need to be addressed; human life is always more important than protecting a facility
or the assets it contains.
- When looking at locations for a facility, consider local crime; natural disaster
possibilities; and distance to hospitals, police and fire stations, airports, and railroads.
- Exterior fencing can be costly and unsightly, but can provide crowd control and help
control access to the facility.
- If interior partitions do not go all the way up to the true ceiling, an intruder can
remove a ceiling tile and climb over the partition into a critical portion of the facility.
- The primary power source is what is used in day-to-day operations, and the
alternative power source is a backup in case the primary source fails.
- Smoke detectors should be located on and above suspended ceilings, below raised
floors, and in air ducts to provide maximum fire detection.
- A fire needs high temperatures, oxygen, and fuel. To suppress it, one or more of those
items needs to be reduced or eliminated.
- Gases like FM-200 and other halon substitutes interfere with the chemical reaction of
a fire.
- Portable fire extinguishers should be located within 50 feet of electrical equipment
and should be inspected quarterly.
- CO2
is a colorless, odorless, and potentially lethal substance because it removes the
oxygen from the air in order to suppress fires.
- CPTED provides three main strategies, which are natural access control, natural
surveillance, and natural territorial reinforcement.
- Window types that should be understood are standard, tempered, acrylic, wired, and
laminated.

# Chapter Four - Networking-

- A protocol is a set of rules that dictates how computers communicate over networks.
- The application layer, layer 7, has services and protocols required by the user’s
applications for networking functionality.
- The presentation layer, layer 6, formats data into a standardized format and deals
with the syntax of the data, not the meaning.
- The session layer, layer 5, sets up, maintains, and breaks down the dialog (session)
between two applications. It controls the dialog organization and synchronization.
- The transport layer, layer 4, provides end-to-end transmissions.
- The network layer, layer 3, provides routing, addressing, and fragmentation of
packets. This layer can determine alternative routes to avoid network congestion.
- Routers work at the network layer, layer 3.
- The data link layer, layer 2, prepares data for the network medium by framing it.
This is where the different LAN and WAN technologies work.
- The physical layer, layer 1, provides physical connections for transmission and
performs the electrical encoding of data. This layer transforms bits to electrical
signals.
- TCP/IP is a suite of protocols that is the de facto standard for transmitting data
across the Internet. TCP is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol, while IP is an
unreliable, connectionless protocol.
- Data is encapsulated as it travels down the network stack on the source computer,
and the process is reversed on the destination computer. During encapsulation, each
layer adds its own information so the corresponding layer on the destination
computer knows how to process the data.
- Two main protocols at the transport layer are TCP and UDP.
- UDP is a connectionless protocol that does not send or receive acknowledgments
when a datagram is received. It does not ensure data arrives at its destination. It
provides “best-effort” delivery.
- TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that sends and receives acknowledgments. It
ensures data arrives at the destination.
- ARP translates the IP address into a MAC address (physical Ethernet address), while
RARP translates a MAC address into an IP address.
- ICMP works at the network layer and informs hosts, routers, and devices of network
or computer problems. It is the major component of the ping utility.
853
- DNS resolves hostnames into IP addresses and has distributed databases all over the
Internet to provide name resolution.
- Altering an ARP table so an IP address is mapped to a different MAC address is called
ARP poisoning and can redirect traffic to an attacker’s computer or an unattended
system.
- Packet filtering (screening routers) is accomplished by ACLs and is a first-generation
firewall. Traffic can be filtered by addresses, ports, and protocol types.
- Tunneling protocols move frames from one network to another by placing them
inside of routable encapsulated frames.
- Packet filtering provides application independence, high performance, and scalability,
but it provides low security and no protection above the network layer.
- Dual-homed firewalls can be bypassed if the operating system does not have packet
forwarding or routing disabled.
- Firewalls that use proxies transfer an isolated copy of each approved packet from one
network to another network.
- An application proxy requires a proxy for each approved service and can understand
and make access decisions on the protocols used and the commands within those
protocols.
- Circuit-level firewalls also use proxies but at a lower layer. Circuit-level firewalls do
not look as deep within the packet as application proxies do.
- A proxy firewall is the middleman in communication. It does not allow anyone to
connect directly to a protected host within the internal network. Proxy firewalls are
second-generation firewalls.
- Application proxy firewalls provide high security and have full application-layer
awareness, but they can have poor performance, limited application support, and
poor scalability.
- Stateful inspection keeps track of each communication session. It must maintain a
state table that contains data about each connection. It is a third-generation firewall.
- VPN can use PPTP, L2TP, TLS, or IPSec as tunneling protocols.
- PPTP works at the data link layer and can only handle one connection. IPSec works
at the network layer and can handle multiple tunnels at the same time.
- Dedicated links are usually the most expensive type of WAN connectivity method
because the fee is based on the distance between the two destinations rather than on
the amount of bandwidth used. T1 and T3 are examples of dedicated links.
- Frame relay and X.25 are packet-switched WAN technologies that use virtual circuits
instead of dedicated ones.
- A switch in star topologies serves as the central meeting place for all cables from
computers and devices.
- A switch is a device with combined repeater and bridge technology. It works at the
data link layer and understands MAC addresses.
854
- Routers link two or more network segments, where each segment can function as an
independent network. A router works at the network layer, works with IP addresses,
and has more network knowledge than bridges, switches, or repeaters.
- A bridge filters by MAC addresses and forwards broadcast traffic. A router filters by
IP addresses and does not forward broadcast traffic.
- Layer 3 switching combines switching and routing technology.
- Attenuation is the loss of signal strength when a cable exceeds its maximum length.
- STP and UTP are twisted-pair cabling types that are the most popular, cheapest, and
easiest to work with. However, they are the easiest to tap into, have crosstalk issues,
and are vulnerable to EMI and RFI.
- Fiber-optic cabling carries data as light waves, is expensive, can transmit data at high
speeds, is difficult to tap into, and is resistant to EMI and RFI. If security is extremely
important, fiber-optic cabling should be used.
- ATM transfers data in fixed cells, is a WAN technology, and transmits data at very
high rates. It supports voice, data, and video applications.
- FDDI is a LAN and MAN technology, usually used for backbones, that uses tokenpassing technology and has redundant rings in case the primary ring goes down.
- Token Ring, 802.5, is an older LAN implementation that uses a token-passing
technology.
- Ethernet uses CSMA/CD, which means all computers compete for the shared
network cable, listen to learn when they can transmit data, and are susceptible to data
collisions.
- Circuit-switching technologies set up a circuit that will be used during a data
transmission session. Packet-switching technologies do not set up circuits—instead,
packets can travel along many different routes to arrive at the same destination.
- ISDN has a BRI rate that uses two B channels and one D channel, and a PRI rate
that uses up to 23 B channels and one D channel. They support voice, data, and
video.
- PPP is an encapsulation protocol for telecommunication connections. It replaced
SLIP and is ideal for connecting different types of devices over serial lines.
- PAP sends credentials in cleartext, and CHAP authenticates using a
challenge/response mechanism and therefore does not send passwords over the
network.
- SOCKS is a proxy-based firewall solution. It is a circuit-based proxy firewall and does
not use application-based proxies.
- IPSec tunnel mode protects the payload and header information of a packet, while
IPSec transport mode protects only the payload.
- A screened-host firewall lies between the perimeter router and the LAN, and a
screened subnet is a DMZ created by two physical firewalls.
- NAT is used when companies do not want systems to know internal hosts’ addresses,
and it enables companies to use private, nonroutable IP addresses.
855
- The 802.15 standard outlines wireless personal area network (WPAN) technologies,
and 802.16 addresses wireless MAN technologies.
- Environments can be segmented into different WLANs by using different SSIDs.
- The 802.11b standard works in the 2.4-GHz range at 11 Mbps, and 802.11a works
in the 5-GHz range at 54 Mbps.
- IPv4 uses 32 bits for its addresses, whereas IPv6 uses 128 bits; thus, IPv6 provides
more possible addresses with which to work.
- Subnetting allows large IP ranges to be divided into smaller, logical, and easier-tomaintain network segments.
- SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is a signaling protocol widely used for VoIP
communications sessions.
- Open relay is an SMTP server that is configured in such a way that it can transmit email messages from any source to any destination.
- SNMP uses agents and managers. Agents collect and maintain device-oriented data,
which is held in management information bases. Managers poll the agents using
community string values for authentication purposes.
- Three main types of multiplexing are statistical time division, frequency division, and
wave division.
- Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) provides a standardized packet format for
delivering audio and video over IP networks. It works with RTP Control Protocol,
which provides out-of-band statistics and control information to provide feedback on
QoS levels.
- 802.1AR provides a unique ID for a device. 802.1AE provides data encryption,
integrity, and origin authentication functionality at the data link level. 802.1AF
carries out key agreement functions for the session keys used for data encryption.
Each of these standards provides specific parameters to work within an 802.1X EAPTLS framework.
- Lightweight EAP was developed by Cisco and was the first implementation of EAP
and 802.1X for wireless networks. It uses preshared keys and MS-CHAP to
authenticate client and server to each other.
- In EAP-TLS the client and server authenticate to each other using digital certificates.
The client generates a pre-master secret key by encrypting a random number with the
server’s public key and sends it to the server.
- EAP-TTLS is similar to EAP-TLS, but only the server must use a digital certification
for authentication to the client. The client can use any other EAP authentication
method or legacy PAP or CHAP methods.
- Network convergence means the combining of server, storage, and network
capabilities into a single framework.
- Mobile telephony has gone through different generations and multiple access
technologies: 1G (FDMA), 2G (TDMA), 3G (CDMA), and 4G (OFDM).
- Link encryption is limited to two directly connected devices, so the message must be
856
decrypted (and potentially re-encrypted) at each hop.
- The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol is an example of a link encryption
technology.
- End-to-end encryption involves the source and destination nodes, so the message is
not decrypted by intermediate nodes.
- Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an example of an end-to-end encryption
technology.
- Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is a technical specification
indicating how multimedia data and e-mail binary attachments are to be transferred.
- Secure MIME (S/MIME) is a standard for encrypting and digitally signing e-mail
and for providing secure data transmissions using public key infrastructure (PKI).
- Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a freeware e-mail security program that uses PKI based
on a web of trust.
- S/MIME and PGP are incompatible because the former uses centralized, hierarchical
Certificate Authorities (CAs) while the latter uses a distributed web of trust.
- HTTP Secure (HTTPS) is HTTP running over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or
Transport Layer Security (TLS).
- SSL was formally deprecated in June of 2015.
- Cookies are text files that a browser maintains on a user’s hard drive or memory
segment in order to remember the user or maintain the state of a web application.
- Secure Shell (SSH) functions as a type of tunneling mechanism that provides
terminal-like access to remote computers.
- A denial-of-service (DoS) attack results in a service or resource being degraded or
made unavailable to legitimate users.
- DNS hijacking is an attack that forces the victim to use a malicious DNS server
instead of the legitimate one.
- DNS hijacking is an attack that forces the victim to use a malicious DNS server
instead of the legitimate one.


# Chapter Five -

- Access is a flow of information between a subject and an object.
- A subject is an active entity that requests access to an object, which is a passive entity.
- A subject can be a user, program, or process.
- Some security mechanisms that provide confidentiality are encryption, logical and
physical access control, transmission protocols, database views, and controlled traffic
flow.
- Identity management (IdM) solutions include directories, web access management,
password management, legacy single sign-on, account management, and profile
update.
- Password synchronization reduces the complexity of keeping up with different
passwords for different systems.
- Self-service password reset reduces help-desk call volumes by allowing users to reset
their own passwords.
- Assisted password reset reduces the resolution process for password issues for the
help-desk department.
- IdM directories contain all resource information, users’ attributes, authorization
profiles, roles, and possibly access control policies so other IdM applications have one
centralized resource from which to gather this information.
- An automated workflow component is common in account management products
that provide IdM solutions.
- User provisioning refers to the creation, maintenance, and deactivation of user objects
and attributes as they exist in one or more systems, directories, or applications.
- User access reviews ensure there are no active accounts that are no longer needed.
- The HR database is usually considered the authoritative source for user identities
because that is where each user’s identity is first developed and properly maintained.
- There are five main access control models: discretionary, mandatory, role based, rule
based, and attribute based.
- Discretionary access control (DAC) enables data owners to dictate what subjects have
access to the files and resources they own.
- The mandatory access control (MAC) model uses a security label system. Users have
clearances, and resources have security labels that contain data classifications. MAC
systems compare these two attributes to determine access control capabilities.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is based on the user’s role and responsibilities
(tasks) within the company.
1015
- Rule-based RBAC (RB-RBAC) builds on RBAC by adding Boolean logic in the form
of rules or policies that further restrict access.
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is based on attributes of any component of the
system. It is the most granular of the access control models.
- Three main types of constrained user interface measurements exist: menus and shells,
database views, and physically constrained interfaces.
- Access control lists are bound to objects and indicate what subjects can use them.
- A capability table is bound to a subject and lists what objects it can access.
- Some examples of remote access control technologies are RADIUS, TACACS+, and
Diameter.
- Examples of administrative controls are a security policy, personnel controls,
supervisory structure, security awareness training, and testing.
- Examples of physical controls are network segregation, perimeter security, computer
controls, work area separation, and cable.
- Examples of technical controls are system access, network architecture, network
access, encryption and protocols, and auditing.
- For a subject to be able to access a resource, it must be identified, authenticated, and
authorized, and should be held accountable for its actions.
- Authentication can be accomplished by biometrics, a password, a passphrase, a
cognitive password, a one-time password, or a token.
- A Type I error in biometrics means the system rejected an authorized individual, and
a Type II error means an imposter was authenticated.
- A memory card cannot process information, but a smart card can through the use of
integrated circuits and processors.
- Least-privilege and need-to-know principles limit users’ rights to only what is needed
to perform tasks of their job.
- Single sign-on capabilities can be accomplished through Kerberos, domains, and thin
clients.
- The Kerberos user receives a ticket granting ticket (TGT), which allows him to
request access to resources through the ticket granting service (TGS). The TGS
generates a new ticket with the session keys.
- Keystroke monitoring is a type of auditing that tracks each keystroke made by a user.
- Object reuse can unintentionally disclose information by assigning media to a subject
before it is properly erased.
- Just removing pointers to files (deleting file, formatting hard drive) is not always
enough protection for proper object reuse.
- Information can be obtained via electrical signals in airwaves. The ways to combat
this type of intrusion are TEMPEST, white noise, and control zones.
- User authentication is accomplished by what someone knows, is, or has.
- One-time password-generating token devices can use synchronous (time, event) or
1016
asynchronous (challenge-based) methods.
- Strong authentication requires two of the three user authentication attributes (what
someone knows, is, or has).
- The following are weaknesses of Kerberos: the KDC is a single point of failure; it is
susceptible to password guessing; session and secret keys are locally stored; KDC
needs to always be available; and there must be management of secret keys.
- Phishing is a type of social engineering with the goal of obtaining personal
information, credentials, credit card numbers, or financial data.
- A race condition is possible when two or more processes use a shared resource and the
access steps could take place out of sequence.
- Mutual authentication is when two entities must authenticate to each other before
sending data back and forth. Also referred to as two-way authentication.
- A directory service is a software component that stores, organizes, and provides access
to resources, which are listed in a directory (listing) of resources. Individual resources
are assigned names within a namespace.
- A cookie is data that is held permanently on a hard drive in the format of a text file or
held temporarily in memory. It can be used to store browsing habits, authentication
data, or protocol state information.
- A federated identity is a portable identity, and its associated entitlements, that can be
used across business boundaries without the need to synchronize or consolidate
directory information.
- Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a set of rules for encoding documents in
machine-readable form to allow for interoperability between various web-based
technologies.
- Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML) is an XML-based framework being
developed by OASIS for exchanging user, resource, and service provisioning
information between cooperating organizations.
- Extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML), which is both a declarative
access control policy language implemented in XML and a processing model,
describes how to interpret security policies.
- Replay attack is a form of network attack in which a valid data transmission is
maliciously or fraudulently repeated with the goal of obtaining unauthorized access.
- Clipping level is a threshold value. Once a threshold value is passed, the activity is
considered to be an event that is logged, investigated, or both.
- A rainbow table is a set of precomputed hash values that represents password
combinations. Rainbow tables are used in password attack processes and usually
produce results more quickly than dictionary or brute-force attacks.
- Cognitive passwords are fact- or opinion-based information used to verify an
individual’s identity.
- Smart cards can require physical interaction with a reader (contact) or no physical
interaction with the reader (contactless architectures). Two contactless architectures
1017
are combi (one chip) and hybrid (two chips).
- A side channel attack is carried out by gathering data pertaining to how something
works and using that data to attack it or crack it, as in differential power analysis or
electromagnetic analysis.
- Authorization creep takes place when a user gains too much access rights and
permissions over time.
- Security information and event management implements data mining and analysis
functionality to be carried out on centralized logs for situational awareness
capabilities.
- Intrusion detection systems are either host or network based and provide behavioral
(statistical) or signature (knowledge) types of functionality.
- Phishing is a type of social engineering attack. If it is crafted for a specific individual,
it is called spear-phishing. If a DNS server is poisoned and points users to a malicious
website, this is referred to as pharming.
- A web portal is commonly made up of portlets, which are pluggable user interface
software components that present information and services from other systems.
- The Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML) allows for the automation of
user management (account creation, amendments, revocation) and access entitlement
configuration related to electronically published services across multiple provisioning
systems.
- The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) allows for the exchange of
authentication and authorization data to be shared between security domains.
- OpenID is an open standard and protocol that allows third-party authentication of a
user.
- OAuth is an open standard that allows a user to grant authority to some web
resource, like a contacts database, to a third party.
- OpenID Connect is an authentication layer built on the OAuth 2.0 protocol that
allows transparent authentication and authorization of client resource requests.
- The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a protocol specification for exchanging
structured information in the implementation of web services and networked
environments.
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA) environments allow for a suite of interoperable
services to be used within multiple, separate systems from several business domains.
- Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a technology that provides data
communication through the use of radio waves.


# Chapter Six -

- An audit is a systematic assessment of the security controls of an information system.
- Setting a clear set of goals is probably the most important step of planning a security
audit.
- Internal audits benefit from the auditors’ familiarity with the systems, but may be
hindered by a lack of exposure to how others attack and defend systems.
- External audits happen when organizations have a contract in place that includes
security provisions. The contracting party can demand to audit the contractor to
ensure those provisions are being met.
- Third-party audits typically bring a much broader background of experience that can
provide fresh insights, but can be expensive.
- Test coverage is a measure of how much of a system is examined by a specific test (or
group of tests).
- A vulnerability test is an examination of a system for the purpose of identifying,
defining, and ranking its vulnerabilities.
- Black box testing treats the system being tested as completely opaque.
- White box testing affords the auditor complete knowledge of the inner workings of
the system even before the first scan is performed.
- Gray box testing gives the auditor some, but not all, information about the internal
workings of the system.
1094
- Penetration testing is the process of simulating attacks on a network and its systems at
the request of the owner.
- A blind test is one in which the assessors only have publicly available data to work
with and the network security staff is aware that the testing will occur.
- A double-blind test (stealth assessment) is a blind test in which the network security
staff is not notified that testing will occur.
- War dialing allows attackers and administrators to dial large blocks of phone numbers
in search of available modems.
- A log review is the examination of system log files to detect security events or to verify
the effectiveness of security controls.
- Synthetic transactions are scripted events that mimic the behaviors of real users and
allow security professionals to systematically test the performance of critical services.
- A misuse case is a use case that includes threat actors and the tasks they want to
perform on the system.
- A code review is a systematic examination of the instructions that comprise a piece of
software, performed by someone other than the author of that code.
- Interface testing is the systematic evaluation of a given set of exchange points for data
between systems and/or users.
- Administrative controls are implemented primarily through policies or procedures.
- Privileged user accounts pose significant risk to the organization and should be
carefully managed and controlled.
- User accounts should be promptly suspended whenever the user departs the
organization permanently or for an extended period.
- Data backups should not be considered reliable unless they have been verified to be
usable to restore data.
- A business continuity plan (BCP) ensures that the critical business processes of an
organization remain uninterrupted or are quickly restored after a serious event.
- A disaster recovery plan (DRP) ensures that the information systems supporting
critical business processes remain operational or are quickly restored in the event of a
disaster.
- The BCP and DRP both need to be evaluated regularly to ensure they remain
effective in the face of environmental changes in and around the organization.
- Security training is the process of teaching a skill or set of skills that will allow people
to better perform specific functions.
- Security awareness training is the process of exposing people to security issues so that
they may be able to recognize them and better respond to them.
- Social engineering, in the context of information security, is the process of
manipulating individuals so that they perform actions that violate security protocols.
- Phishing is social engineering conducted through a digital communication.
- A drive-by download is an automatic attack that is triggered simply by visiting a
1095
malicious website.
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) measure the effectiveness of an organization in
performing a given task at a given point in time.
- Key risk indicators (KRIs) measure the risk inherent in performing a given action or
set of actions.
- Reports must be written with a specific audience in mind if they are to be effective.
- A management review is a formal meeting in which senior organizational leaders
determine whether the information security management systems are effectively
accomplishing their goals.



# Chapter Seven -

- Facilities that house systems that process sensitive information should have physical
access controls to limit access to authorized personnel only.
- Clipping levels should be implemented to establish a baseline of user activity and
acceptable errors.
- Separation of responsibilities and duties should be in place so that if fraud takes place,
it requires collusion.
- Access to resources should be limited to authorized personnel, applications, and
services and should be audited for compliance to stated policies.
- Change control and configuration management should be put in place so changes are
approved, documented, tested, and properly implemented.
- Activities that involve change management include requesting a change, approving a
change, documenting a change, testing a change, implementing a change, and
reporting to management.
- Proper fault-tolerant mechanisms should be put in place to counter equipment
failure.
- Antivirus and IDS signatures should be updated on a continual basis.
- Continuous monitoring allows organizations to maintain ongoing awareness of
information security, vulnerabilities, and threats to support organizational risk
management decisions.
- A whitelist is a set of known-good resources such as IP addresses, domain names, or
applications. Conversely, a blacklist is a set of known-bad resources.
- A security information and event management (SIEM) system is a software platform
1270
that aggregates security information (like asset inventories) and security events (which
could become incidents) and presents them in a single, consistent, and cohesive
manner.
- The key aspects of operational security include resource protection, change control,
hardware and software controls, trusted system recovery, separation of duties, and
least privilege.
- Least privilege ensures that users, administrators, and others accessing a system have
access only to the objects they absolutely require to complete their job.
- Some physical security controls may conflict with the safety of people. These issues
need to be addressed; human life is always more important than protecting a facility
or the assets it contains.
- Proximity identification devices can be user activated (action needs to be taken by a
user) or system sensing (no action needs to be taken by the user).
- A transponder is a proximity identification device that does not require action by the
user. The reader transmits signals to the device, and the device responds with an
access code.
- Exterior fencing can be costly and unsightly, but can provide crowd control and help
control access to the facility.
- If interior partitions do not go all the way up to the true ceiling, an intruder can
remove a ceiling tile and climb over the partition into a critical portion of the facility.
- Intrusion detection devices include motion detectors, CCTVs, vibration sensors, and
electromechanical devices.
- Intrusion detection devices can be penetrated, are expensive to install and monitor,
require human response, and are subject to false alarms.
- CCTV enables one person to monitor a large area, but should be coupled with
alerting functions to ensure proper response.
- Security guards are expensive but provide flexibility in response to security breaches
and can deter intruders from attempting an attack.
- Vulnerability management is the cyclical process of identifying vulnerabilities,
determining the risks they pose to the organization, and applying security controls
that bring those risks to acceptable levels.
- Patch management is the process for identifying, acquiring, installing, and verifying
patches for products and systems.
- Egress monitoring is the practice of tracking (and perhaps restricting) the information
that is flowing out of a network.
- Offsite backup locations can supply hot, warm, or cold sites.
- A reciprocal agreement is one in which a company promises another company it can
move in and share space if it experiences a disaster, and vice versa. Reciprocal
agreements are very tricky to implement and may be unenforceable. However, they
offer a relatively cheap offsite option and are sometimes the only choice.
- A hot site is fully configured with hardware, software, and environmental needs. It
1271
can usually be up and running in a matter of hours. It is the most expensive option,
but some companies cannot be out of business longer than a day without very
detrimental results.
- A warm site does not have computers, but it does have some peripheral devices, such
as disk drives, controllers, and tape drives. This option is less expensive than a hot
site, but takes more effort and time to become operational.
- A cold site is just a building with power, raised floors, and utilities. No devices are
available. This is the cheapest of the three options, but can take weeks to get up and
operational.
- Recovery time objective (RTO) is the maximum time period within which a business
process must be restored to a designated service level after a disaster to avoid
unacceptable consequences.
- Recovery point objective (RPO) is the acceptable amount of data loss measured in
time.
- Mean time between failures (MTBF) is the predicted amount of time between
inherent failures of a system during operation.
- Mean time to repair (MTTR) is the estimated amount of time it will take to get a
device fixed and back into production after its failure.
- High availability refers to a system, component, or environment that is continuously
operational.
- High availability for disaster recovery is often a combination of technologies and
processes that include backups, redundancy, fault tolerance, clustering, and load
balancing.
- Data recovery and restoration are often carried out through vaulting, backups, and
replication technologies.
- When returning to the original site after a disaster, the least critical organizational
units should go back first.
- COOP focuses on restoring an organization’s (usually a headquarters element)
essential functions at an alternate site and performing those functions for up to 30
days before returning to normal operations. This term is commonly used by the U.S.
government to denote BCP.
- An important part of the business continuity plan is to communicate its requirements
and procedures to all employees.
- Business interruption insurance covers the loss of income that an organization suffers
after a disaster while it is in its recovery stage.
- Due diligence means you’re identifying and analyzing risks; due care means you’re
taking prudent actions day in and day out to mitigate them.
- Elements of negligence include not fulfilling a legally recognized obligation, failure to
conform to a standard of care that results in injury or damage, and proximate
causation.
- The primary reason for the chain of custody of evidence is to ensure that it will be
1272
admissible in court by showing it was properly controlled and handled before being
presented in court.
- To be admissible in court, business records have to be made and collected in the
normal course of business, not specially generated for a case in court. Business records
can easily be hearsay if there is no firsthand proof of their accuracy and reliability.
- The life cycle of evidence includes the identification and collection of the evidence,
and its storage, preservation, transportation, presentation in court, and return to the
owner.
- Collection of computer evidence is a very complex and detail-oriented task. Only
skilled people should attempt it; otherwise, evidence can be ruined forever.
- When looking for suspects, it is important to consider the motive, opportunity, and
means (MOM).
- For evidence to be admissible in court, it needs to be relevant, complete, sufficient,
and reliable to the case at hand.
- Evidence must be legally permissible, meaning it was seized legally and the chain of
custody was not broken.
- Duress is the use of threats or violence against someone in order to force them to do
something they don’t want to do or otherwise wouldn’t do.


# Chapter Eight -

- Security should be addressed in each phase of system development. It should not be
addressed only at the end of development because of the added cost, time, and effort
and the lack of functionality.
- The attack surface is the collection of possible entry points for an attacker. The
reduction of this surface reduces the possible ways that an attacker can exploit a
system.
- Threat modeling is a systematic approach used to understand how different threats
could be realized and how a successful compromise could take place.
- Computer-aided software engineering refers to any type of software that allows for
the automated development of software, which can come in the form of program
editors, debuggers, code analyzers, version-control mechanisms, and more. The goals
are to increase development speed and productivity and reduce errors.
- Various levels of testing should be carried out during development: unit (testing
individual components), integration (verifying components work together in the
production environment), acceptance (ensuring code meets customer requirements),
regression (testing after changes take place), static analysis (reviewing programming
code), and dynamic analysis (reviewing code during execution).
- Fuzzing is the act of sending random data to the target program in order to trigger
failures.
- Zero-day vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that do not currently have a resolution or
solution.
- The ISO/IEC 27034 standard covers the following items: application security
overview and concepts, organization normative framework, application security
management process, protocols and application security control data structure, case
studies, and application security assurance prediction.
- The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an organization dedicated
to helping the industry develop more secure software.
- An integrated product team (IPT) is a multidisciplinary development team with
representatives from many or all the stakeholder populations.
- The CMMI model uses five maturity levels designated by the numbers 1 through 5.
Each level represents the maturity level of the process quality and optimization. The
1423
levels are organized as follows: 1 = Initial, 2 = Repeatable, 3 = Defined, 4 = Managed,
5 = Optimizing.
- CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) is a process improvement approach
that provides organizations with the essential elements of effective processes, which
will improve their performance.
- Change management is a systematic approach to deliberately regulating the changing
nature of projects. Change control, which is a subpart of change management, deals
with controlling specific changes to a system.
- There are several SDLC methodologies: Waterfall (sequential approach that requires
each phase to complete before the next one can begin), V-shaped (emphasizes
verification and validation at each phase), Prototyping (creating a sample of the code
for proof-of-concept purposes), Incremental (multiple development cycles are carried
out on a piece of software throughout its development stages), Spiral (iterative
approach that emphases risk analysis per iteration), Rapid Application Development
(combines prototyping and iterative development procedures with the goal of
accelerating the software development process), and Agile (iterative and incremental
development processes that encourage team-based collaboration, where flexibility and
adaptability are used instead of a strict process structure).
- Software configuration management (SCM) is the task of tracking and controlling
changes in the software through the use of authentication, revision control, the
establishment of baselines, and auditing. It has the purpose of maintaining software
integrity and traceability throughout the software development life cycle.
- Programming languages have gone through evolutionary processes. Generation one is
machine language (binary format). Generation two is assembly language (which is
translated by an assembler into machine code). Generation three is high-level
language (which provides a level of abstraction). Generation four is a very high-level
language (which provides more programming abstraction). Generation five is natural
language (which is translated using artificial intelligence).
- Data modeling is a process used to define and analyze data requirements needed to
support the business processes within the scope of corresponding systems and
software applications.
- Object-oriented programming provides modularity, reusability, and more granular
control within the programs themselves compared to classical programming
languages.
- Objects are members, or instances, of classes. The classes dictate the objects’ data
types, structure, and acceptable actions.
- In OOP, objects communicate with each other through messages, and a method is
functionality that an object can carry out. Objects can communicate properly because
they use standard interfaces.
- Polymorphism is when different objects are given the same input and react
differently.
1424
- Data and operations internal to objects are hidden from other objects, which is
referred to as data hiding. Each object encapsulates its data and processes.
- Object-oriented design represents a real-world problem and modularizes the problem
into cooperating objects that work together to solve the problem.
- If an object does not require much interaction with other modules, it has low
coupling.
- The best programming design enables objects to be as independent and as modular as
possible; therefore, the higher the cohesion and the lower the coupling, the better.
- An object request broker (ORB) manages communications between objects and
enables them to interact in a heterogeneous and distributed environment.
- Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) provides a standardized
way for objects within different applications, platforms, and environments to
communicate. It accomplishes this by providing standards for interfaces between
objects.
- Component Object Model (COM) provides an architecture for components to
interact on a local system. Distributed COM (DCOM) uses the same interfaces as
COM, but enables components to interact over a distributed, or networked,
environment.
- Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) enables several different applications to
communicate with several different types of databases by calling the required driver
and passing data through that driver.
- Object linking and embedding (OLE) enables a program to call another program
(linking) and permits a piece of data to be inserted inside another program or
document (embedding).
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA) provides standardized access to the most needed
services to many different applications at one time. Service interactions are selfcontained and loosely coupled so that each interaction is independent of any other
interaction.
- Java security employs a sandbox so the applet is restricted from accessing the user’s
hard drive or system resources. Programmers have figured out how to write applets
that escape the sandbox.
- SOAP allows programs created with different programming languages and running
on different operating systems to interact without compatibility issues.
- There are three main types of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks: nonpersistent XSS
(exploiting the lack of proper input or output validation on dynamic websites),
persistent XSS (attacker loads malicious code on a server that attacks visiting
browsers), and DOM (attacker uses the DOM environment to modify the original
client-side JavaScript).
- A database management system (DBMS) is the software that controls the access
restrictions, data integrity, redundancy, and the different types of manipulation
available for a database.
1425
- A database primary key is how a specific row is located from other parts of the
database in a relational database.
- A view is an access control mechanism used in databases to ensure that only
authorized subjects can access sensitive information.
- A relational database uses two-dimensional tables with rows (tuples) and columns
(attributes).
- A hierarchical database uses a tree-like structure to define relationships between data
elements, using a parent/child relationship.
- Most databases have a data definition language (DDL), a data manipulation language
(DML), a query language (QL), and a report generator.
- A data dictionary is a central repository that describes the data elements within a
database and their relationships.
- Database integrity is provided by concurrency mechanisms. One concurrency control
is locking, which prevents users from accessing and modifying data being used by

- Entity integrity makes sure that a row, or tuple, is uniquely identified by a primary
key, and referential integrity ensures that every foreign key refers to an existing
primary key.
- A rollback cancels changes and returns the database to its previous state. This takes
place if there is a problem during a transaction.
- A commit statement saves all changes to the database.
- A checkpoint is used if there is a system failure or problem during a transaction. The
user is then returned to the state of the last checkpoint.
- Aggregation can happen if a user does not have access to a group of elements, but has
access to some of the individual elements within the group. Aggregation happens if
the user combines the information of these individual elements and figures out the
information of the group of data elements, which is at a higher sensitivity level.
- Inference is the capability to derive information that is not explicitly available.
- Common attempts to prevent inference attacks are partitioning the database, cell
suppression, and adding noise to the database.
- Polyinstantiation is the process of allowing a table to have multiple rows with the
same primary key. The different instances can be distinguished by their security levels
or classifications.
- Data warehousing combines data from multiple databases and data sources.
- Data mining is the process of searching, filtering, and associating data held within a
data warehouse to provide more useful information to users.
- Data-mining tools produce metadata, which can contain previously unseen
relationships and patterns.
- A virus is an application that requires a host application for replication.
- Macro viruses are common because the languages used to develop macros are easy to
1426
use and they infect Microsoft Office products, which are everywhere.
- A polymorphic virus tries to escape detection by making copies of itself and
modifying the code and attributes of those copies.
- A worm does not require a host application to replicate.
- A logic bomb executes a program when a predefined event takes place, or a date and
time are met.
- A Trojan horse is a program that performs useful functionality apparent to the user
and malicious functionally without the user knowing it.
- Botnets are networks of bots that are controlled by C&C servers and bot herders.
- Antimalware software is most effective when it is installed in every entry and end
point and covered by a policy that delineates user training as well as software
configuration and updating.
- Assessing the security of acquired software, in addition to internal or third-party tests,
requires that we assess the reliability and maturity of the vendor.
