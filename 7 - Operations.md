**How to test coverate computed**


    (A) the total lines of code in the piece of software you are testing, and
    (B) the number of lines of code all test cases currently execute, and
    Find (B divided by A) multiplied by 100 â€“ this will be your test coverage %.


- Formula = (A * B) * 100 = coverage%
    - (650 / 1000) * 100 = 65%
